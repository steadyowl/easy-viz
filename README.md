# easy-viz
An experiment using github pages to create a web based visualization tool
This will be a static website and will use html + css + javascript (VueJS)
The user should be able to dump some data to and the web-app should be able to make sense of it an create one or more useful charts/graphs. The default charts/graphs should look pleasing and offer some customization options.
